This is my project on sorting visualizer.
Build on Html, Css , javascript and Node.js
considering main 6 sorting here Bubble sort, Insertion sort, Mersge sort, Quick sort, Selection Sort and Heap sort.
There is also some information about those sort like how is it and how it's working, what's the time complexity on those and many more.
The most interesting thing that while sorting you can find the all steps of sort, the value in every steps and the codes of the sort in java, javascript, python , c and c++
